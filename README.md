My vimrc and snippets

## Installation

You need to install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), then clone this repository, move the `.vimrc` file to your home directory, open it, and run `:PluginInstall`. This will install the list of plugins in the vimrc file itself.

If you want to use my own custom snippets (not completely recommended, but whatevs), then I'd recommend softlinking the `UltiSnips` directory into your `.vim` directory (which is where the `UltiSnips` plugin looks for your custom snippets. 

*Note*: `UltiSnips` specifically requires installation of `vim` > 7.4 AND that vim be compiled with python 2.7 or greater.
